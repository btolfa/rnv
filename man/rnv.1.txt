NAME
----
rnv - Relax NG Compact Syntax validator

SYNOPSIS
--------
*rnv* ['OPTIONS'] 'grammar.rnc' {'document1.xml'}

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*RNV* uses Relax NG compact syntax schemas to check if a give XML file is valid in respect to the language defined by the Relax NG schema. RNV uses Expat for XML parsing. 

If you intend to validate against Relax NG schemas in XML syntax instead have a look at *xmllint* (of libxml2) or *xmlstarlet*. Also *trang* can convert Relax NG schemas from XML to compact syntax and back.

OPTIONS
-------
If no documents are specified, *RNV* attempts to read the XML document from the standard input. The options are:

*-q*::
	names of files being processed are not printed. In error messages, expected elements and attributes are not listed.

*-n* 'number'::
	sets the maximum number of reported expected elements and attributes, *-q* sets this to 0 and can be overriden.

*-p*::
	copies input to the output.

*c*::
	if the only argument is a grammar, checks the grammar and exits.

*-o*::
	uses less memory and runs slower.

*-d* 'executable'::
	uses given executable as a datatype plugin. An example implementation of XSD datatype plugin is provided both as a binary (xsdck(1)) and as a source in exaples directory (xsdck.c).

*-v*::
	prints version number.

*-h*::
	displays usage summary and exits/
