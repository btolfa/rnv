NAME
----
arx - automatically determines the type of an XML document

SYNOPSIS
--------
*arx* ['OPTIONS'] 'document.xml' {'config_file.conf' ...}

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ARX* is a tool to automatically determine the type of a document from its name and contents. It is inspired by James Clark's schema location approach for nXML.

OPTIONS
-------
ARX either prints a string corresponding to the document's type or nothing if the type cannot be determine. You can specify configuration files to override defaults in /etc/arx.conf. The options are:

*-n*::
turns off prepending base path of the configuration file to the result, even if it looks like a relative path (useful when the configuration file and the grammars are in separate directories, or for association with something that is not a file).

*-v*::
prints current version

*-h*::
displays usage summary and exits

FILES
-----
/etc/rnv/arx.conf

The configuration file must conform to the following grammar:

 arx = grammars route*
 grammars = "grammars" "{" type2string+ "}"
 type2string = type "=" literal
 type = nmtoken
 route = match|nomatch|valid|invalid
 match = "=~" regexp "=>" type
 nomatch = "!~" regexp "=>" type
 valid = "valid" "{" rng "}" "=>" type
 invalid = "!valid" "{" rng "}" "=>" type

 literal = string in '"', '"' inside must be prepended by '´
 regexp = string in '/', '/' inside must be prepended by '´
 rng = Relax NG Compact Syntax

Comments start with # and continue till the end of line.

Rules are processed sequentially, the first matching rule determines the file's type.
Relax NG templates are matched against file contents, regular expressions are applied
to file names.

EXAMPLES
--------
The sample configuration below associates documents with grammars for XSLT, DocBook or XSL FO:

 grammars {
 docbook="docbook.rnc"
 xslt="xslt.rnc"
 xslfo="fo.rnc"
 }

 valid {
 start = element (book|article|chapter|reference) {any}
 any = (element * {any}|attribute * {text}|text)*
 } => docbook

 !valid {
 default namespace xsl = "http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
 start = element *-xsl:* {not-xsl}
 not-xsl = (element *-xsl:* {not-xsl}|attribute * {text}|text)*
 } => xslt

 =~/.*.xsl/ => xslt
 =~/.*.fo/ => xslfo
