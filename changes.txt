1.3.1
Mon Dec 29 01:58:38 AMT 2003
dvd invalid elements are correctly skipped (they were supposed to before), but the code
    contained a fallout that prevented them from doing so

1.3.0 Mon Dec 29 01:57:46 AMT 2003
dvd: pattern pools are now one-dimensional, pointer arithmetics is a little more
     complex, but performance and memory use are better; besides, this makes pattern
     datatype extensible, which is a good thing

1.2.1 Fri Dec 26 15:50:49 AMT 2003
dvd: error reporting redone; errors for xsd and rx are routed through validation
     errors' handler

Fri Dec 26 01:55:37 AMT 2003
dvd: debugged on NIST tests; the only tests which don't pass when they should
     are those with doubles due to overflow and underflow.

Thu Dec 25 19:30:55 AMT 2003
dvd: added puorg_nr to implement attribute_open correctly;
     empty elements are correctly validated against data and values;
     equality and ordering for dateTime (and its partial variants) implemented;
     rx,xsd use overloadable error handlers with variable lists.

1.2.0 Wed Dec 24 04:40:25 AMT 2003
dvd: XML Schema Part 2: regular expressions and datatypes. many things are
     implemented, with exception of context-dependent checks and a calendar
     library; optimizations and cleanups.

Fri Dec 19 22:19:05 AMT 2003
dvd: rn_params joined with rn_string

1.1.0 Fri Dec 19 03:56:46 AMT 2003
dvd: drv_attribute_open|drv_attribute_close and memoization implemented; 
     hash values are multiplied by large primes - helps with current hashing
     algorithms; garbage collection added to rn (rn_compress,
     rn_compress_last); compact mode implemented for validation, the buffer for
     memoized patterns does not exceed a limit when the validator runs in
     compact mode.
     
1.0.9 Wed Dec 17 23:36:05 AMT 2003
dvd: drv_mixed_text added, results memoized; code cleanups to compile easier;
     added targets for static and shared libraries to the Makefile, many small
     touch-ups

1.0.8; Tue Dec 16 14:05:16 AMT 2003
dvd: memory for error message in rnv.c is allocated properly

1.0.7; Tue Dec 16 00:12:04 AMT 2003
dvd: added reporting of attribute value for invalid attributes
