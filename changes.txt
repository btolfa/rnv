1.1.0 Fri Dec 19 03:56:46 AMT 2003
dvd: drv_attribute_open|drv_attribute_close and memoization implemented; 
     hash values are multiplied by large primes - helps with current hashing
     algorithms; garbage collection added to rn (rn_compress,
     rn_compress_last); compact mode implemented for validation, the buffer for
     memoized patterns does not exceed a limit when the validator runs in
     compact mode.
