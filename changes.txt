1.1.1 Fri Dec 19 22:21:15 AMT 2003
dvd: parameters buffer allocated properly, no space is allocated if no parameters;
     hash table for string entries is initially 1/16 of the string buffer, which
     is roughly the average value

1.1.0 Thu Dec 18 05:05:33 AMT 2003
dvd: drv_start_attribute and memoization implemented; hash values are 
     multiplied by large primes - helps with current hashing algorithms;
     garbage collection added to rn (rn_compress, rn_compress_last);
     compact mode implemented for validation, the buffer for memoized patterns
     does not exceed a limit when the validator runs in compact mode.
     
1.0.9 Wed Dec 17 23:36:05 AMT 2003
dvd: drv_mixed_text added, results memoized; code cleanups to compile easier;
     added targets for static and shared libraries to the Makefile, many small
     touch-ups

1.0.8; Tue Dec 16 14:05:16 AMT 2003
dvd: memory for error message in rnv.c is allocated properly

1.0.7; Tue Dec 16 00:12:04 AMT 2003
